# ITU Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet

The ITU (International Telecommunication Union) Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet is a standardized set of code words used to clarify the spelling of letters in voice communications. This helps reduce errors and misunderstandings, especially in noisy or low-quality communication environments such as radio transmissions. Although commonly referred to as the "NATO phonetic alphabet," both organizations share the same spelling alphabet.

## Alphabet Overview

Below is the complete list of the ITU (NATO) phonetic alphabet code words. Each letter is associated with a standardized code word and a suggested pronunciation guide.

## Usage

1. **Clarity in Communication**  
   - The primary goal is to ensure that letters are not confused during voice transmissions. For example, "M" might be heard as "N," but "Mike" and "November" are much clearer.

2. **Common Environments**  
   - Air traffic control, maritime navigation, emergency services, and military operations frequently rely on phonetic alphabets to minimize errors over radio or phone lines.

3. **Spelling Out Words**  
   - When spelling a name, location, or other critical terms, each letter is pronounced using its corresponding code word.  
   - For example, if you need to spell "CAT," you would say "Charlie Alpha Tango."

4. **Consistency**  
   - It is important to always use the correct code wordsâ€”avoid making up alternatives for letters because the goal is standardization and global consistency.
